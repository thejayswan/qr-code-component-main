## My process

Started with the appropriate HTML page requirements and then began to layer in the CSS design elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I enjoyed this project.  It seemed like I may have used the most simple solution to complete the outcome; however, it seems relavent to desired outcome.



### Continued development

I would like to revisit this and utilize some responsive design and @media to create the final product.
